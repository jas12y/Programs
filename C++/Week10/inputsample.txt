Almost all real-world programs use files to store and retrieve data. For example, Word Processing programs are used to create and save files so that they can later be edited and/or printed. "Database Management Systems" create and maintain databases of information. Spreadsheet programs are used to work with numerical data. Compilers are programs that take program source code and create an executable file for users to implement. This data file has been created so that you can practice dealing with data as characters and strings.
